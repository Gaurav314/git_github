Points to cover :


1. Why version control? (A basic overview that why such a thing is needed,INCLUDE REAL LIFE EXAMPLES).
2. A brief introduction to version control systems(VCS).
3. Uses and Advantages.(This part is to be well emphasised, include reasons like GSoc)
4. Why git over others?(A basic difference between VCS ,CVCS and DVCS)
5. Compare git with other version control systems like google docs, dropbox , Subversion ,etc.
6. Include this meme at the end :p

### Version Control. What is it?

* Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
* If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake.
* Especially useful when a project is being handled by a team.


### What we used to do?

1. Make a copy of that folder once you have reached to a substantial position.
2. Disadvatage of this is that it takes a lot of memory and the project has a bad look.

### Types of Version Control: CVCS and DVCS

1. Central Version Control System
	* The code is at a centre hub and all others access it from there.
	* If the central code crashes, the code crashes for all the linked computers.
2. Distributed Version Control System.
	* The central code is distributed  to all the cloned repositories.
	* If the central code crashes, the others will still have access to the code.



### Git over other Version Controls?

1. Git has manual saving.

### Where will git be used?

1. All the major open source projects are hosted here.
2. GSoc and KWoC and all open source projects.<br/>
  [OpenSource-Projects](https://github.com/vivekrj0/SOC-Programs)
3. Here the code is made public for people to see.
