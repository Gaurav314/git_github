### Version Control. What is it and Why?

* Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
* If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake.
* Especially useful when a project is being handled by a team.


### What we used to do?

1. Make a copy of that folder once you have reached to a substantial position.
2. Disadvatage of this is that it takes a lot of memory and the project has a bad look.

### Types of Version Control: CVCS and DVCS

1. Central Version Control System
	* The code is at a centre hub and all others access it from there.
	* If the central code crashes, the code crashes for all the linked computers.
2. Distributed Version Control System.
	* The central code is distributed  to all the cloned repositories.
	* If the central code crashes, the others will still have access to the code.



### Git over other Version Controls?
