Points to cover:


1. Make a local repo.
2. Do git init
3. Write a code. Here teach Concepts of commit, make a visual description, teach about staging area, how you can stage and unstage and then final commit.
You might mention this .gitignore as well. I never knew about it.. Until it was too late.

TAPAS BLOG WILL HELP HERE.


4. Then make some more commits. 
5. Teach git diff    git log    git branch(how to create branches, always tell by visulation on board, will help)    got checkout    git status     git reset   

6. teach the concept of master branch and why should we never commit on master branch rather make a substitute branch work there and then merge to master(teach git merge)



Note: Very important section .. must be taught well.
