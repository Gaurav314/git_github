### Basic linux commands:

* *Path*: Relative and absolute.

* *mkdir* : Makes a new directory in the current path
* *pwd* : Gives the absolute path of the current directory
* *ls* : List of file in the current folder

### Linux preferred over Windows?

1. Doesn't it seem cool to use the terminal?
2. There is no much GUI and hence the speed is quite fast.
3. There is an excellent community support.
