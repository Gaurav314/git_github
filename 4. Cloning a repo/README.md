Points to cover:


1. Introduce to github.
2. Tell concepts of remote(origin and upstream)
3. First teach to fork and then clone. A proper diagram has to be represented about the work flow. 
4. here teach git pull, git fetch, git push as well to the local repo. 
5. Teach how to push to your local repo. Introduce PR here. We will have to discuss how we can structure this page well.

6. I want the people to learn two ways. 
a) Make their own repo and push it to the origin. (git add origin <url> has to be used here.)
b) Clone a repo and contribute there.
